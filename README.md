# Linear Transformations
## Description
- **The goal:** to generate, manipulate, and visualize 2D and 3D objects represented as arrays of coordinates.
- **Functionality:** plotting, scaling by a factor, rotating around, projecting onto, mirroring and shearing along a specified axis.
- **Objects:** McDonald's logo, a Nike 'Swoosh' logo, and a pyramid.
- **Tools:** Python, Numpy, Matplotlib.
## Theoretical intro
**A linear transformation ** is ... It finds its **application** into distinct tasks such as ...<br>
**Matrix of a linear transformation** is ... and can be **interpreted as** ...<br>
For instance, **rotation matrix** ...<br><br>
I must emphasize that the result of a sequence of transformations depends on their **order**.
[examples]<br><br>
When it comes to **reverting** the transformation, ... Not every transformation **has its inverse** though: ...<br>
With the help of a modulo of a determinant ... can be deduced.
